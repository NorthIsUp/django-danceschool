Discounts, Vouchers, Gift Certificates
======================================

Discounts
---------

If you have installed the ``danceschool.discounts`` app, then you are able to offer sophisticated discounts based on the content of a customer's registration.  Here are some examples of things that the discount app can handle:

- x% discount for all first-time customers
- $y discount for registering for two or more regular classes at once
- An 'all-in pass' price where the user can register for as many classes as they would like for a flat fee

Discounts are applied automatically, and the lowest-price available discount is automatically applied.  However, only one discount at a time can be applied to a registration.

Vouchers
--------

If you have installed the ``danceschool.vouchers`` app, then you are able to offer voucher codes, gift certificates, and referral/referree discounts.

Vouchers can be public (e.g. discount codes), or they can be forcibly private (only usable by a specific customer).  They can be restricted to apply only to first-time students, or to apply only to prior students.  It is also possible to add credits to previously generated voucher codes, which can be useful if you are, for example, providing vouchers to students who volunteer for the school.

Gift Certificates
-----------------

A gift certificate is simply a voucher code.  However, if it is enabled by your payment processor (as it is for the built-in Paypal integration), then it is possible to accept online payments for gift certificates.  In this case, a voucher code is generated automatically for the amount paid, and the submitting user is sent an email with a PDF attachment that they can choose to print and give as a gift.

Referral/Referree Program
-------------------------

Some schools like to offer referral discounts to encourage their students to advertise on their behalf.  This project provides a simple way of running a referral/referee discount system.
